                    The Settlement Administration of the Kilmore East – Kinglake & Murrindindi – Marysville Black
                    Saturday
                    Class Actions is now substantially completed. The primary outstanding issue to be resolved is a
                    dispute
                    as to the taxation of the settlement monies, which has proceeded to litigation in the Federal Court
                    of
                    Australia.

                    The Settlement Administration has been overseen by the Supreme Court of Victoria and the Scheme
                    Administrator has provided regular updates to the Court by attending case management hearings and
                    filing
                    written materials containing information about the Settlement Administration and its progress.
